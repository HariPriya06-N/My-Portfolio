  <h2>Group Project: Fotogency Case Study</h2>

  <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
  <p>
    Fotogency is a collaborative web project developed as part of a group effort to practice front-end skills. 
    The project was based on cloning an existing professional photography agency website to learn layout, structure, 
    and design principles. My primary contribution was developing the <strong>Home tab</strong> 
    using semantic HTML5.
  </p>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Practice front-end development by cloning a professional photography website.</li>
    <li>Develop the Home tab using semantic HTML5.</li>
    <li>Collaborate effectively with team members via GitHub.</li>
    <li>Learn project structure, version control, and team communication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)</li>
    <li>JavaScript (for interactivity in other sections)</li>
    <li>GitHub (Repository for collaboration)</li>
    <li>Netlify (Deployment)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Features (Home Tab):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hero section introducing the agency.</li>
    <li>Clean typography and color scheme aligned with photography theme.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Contribution:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed the <strong>Home tab</strong> using semantic HTML5 structure.</li>
    <li>Created the GitHub repository to manage project files and team collaboration.</li>
    <li>Started adding team members and organizing the workflow via Git.</li>
    <li>Ensured the Home page replicated the design of the reference website accurately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenges & Solutions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Coordinating with team members → Used GitHub repo for smooth communication and file management.</li>
    <li>Learning by cloning → Carefully analyzed the original site structure to understand layout and styling.</li>
    <li>No responsiveness → Focused purely on layout and HTML/CSS structure for skill development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcome:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Successful practice project that enhanced front-end skills.</li>
    <li>Developed a functional Home tab using semantic HTML5 and CSS3.</li>
    <li>Learned GitHub collaboration, repository management, and team workflow.</li>
    <li>Deployed version accessible at:
